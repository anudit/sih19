> Registration information of property / vehicle is very crucial to
> identify current and previous ownership. In absence for secure way to
> validate chain of ownership, same property / vehicle can be
> fraudulently sold to multiple person. Similarly, we always want to
> keep records of financial transaction, communication in a way which
> cannot be manipulated and can be referenced in future. Hence there is
> need for system which allow creation of data which cannot be
> manipulated but can be extended

> Land/Real estate registration is corruption prone process which leads
> to lot of Benami transactions. Government tries it's best to eradicate
> the malpractices, but it doesn't yield fruitful result. One way to
> solve this problem is to use blockchain technology in order to capture
> all the Benami transactions related to Land/Real estate deals.

> Every year Millions of units of consumer products are transported from
> farms to factories to distributors to retailers and finally the end
> consumer. To deliver Quality and transparency, Organizations need to
> be able to trace each product to its origin. The challenge is to
> design a solution to track each of the millions of units from point of
> origin to retailer. Traditional bar code based solutions becomes
> difficult to manage beyond the distributors. The design should need
> minimal human effort.

> Design a system by which we can record and make
> visible/non-falsifiable/non-repudiable the different transactions
> between a common citizen and a govt. department for getting and
> managing a particular form of license/permit. For a specific example,
> we consider the driving permit. The system should be able to track the
> different transactions starting from getting the permit
> (retail/commercial), renewal, recording of traffic rule violations,
> and possibly, revocation/suspension

> Frequent cases of personal data leakage has brought back into focus
> the security issues with different KYC programs. A consumer is
> expected to provide his personal identity for authentication by
> different agencies, which is known as KYC, but there is no restriction
> on how much data to be shared with the agencies needing the KYC.
> Consumer should have full control over where and how much data is
> being used by the third parties. We can use a public Blockchain based
> solution to overcome all these.

> Storing the school/university/board certificates is a recurring
> process. For the Organization, verifying the authenticity of the
> certificates is tedious and cumbersome . The proposed solution will
> help the institutions to store the certificates in the decentralized
> way using the block-chain system and give access to any organizations
> or any institution with the consent of the individual using
> multi-sign. What we want: sharable decentralized storage using digital
> signature and access
